# Bird_Denoising_image_segmentation
Bird sound denoising is challenging due to complex background noise in natural environments. Traditional and deep learning methods often result in sub-optimal audio quality. This study re-imagines audio denoising as an image segmentation task using a custom encoder-decoder neural network. We trained our model on a large dataset of bird sound recordings converted into spectrogram images, incorporating data augmentation and early stopping for better generalization. Evaluation on a separate dataset confirms the robustness and reliability of our approach. Our method significantly improves bird sound isolation from background noise, enhancing bird sound recognition and monitoring in diverse acoustic settings. This work lays the foundation for future bio-acoustic research and wildlife conservation.
